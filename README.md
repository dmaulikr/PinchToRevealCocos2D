Kryzstof zablocki (www.merowing.info) wrote a fantastic piece on how to use gesture recognizer in cocos2d and another tutorial on how to create a pinch to reveal animation for UIKit. 
I have built upon his technique and created this project to use Pinch To Reveal gesture in cocos2d. 
The Source code is documented well and you are free to use/modify it in any way you please. 

Through this code you shall learn how to a) Incorporate UIGestureRecognizer in cocos2d (1.0 RC) b) How To Read in a pinch gesture on a CCsprite c) How to split the sprite in two sections based on the pinch gesture's location and move the split sections according to the movement of the pinch gesture.
